# Hackathon

## Your Challenge:

You need to create a matching engine to pair graduates to open positions at the end of the grad scheme.

Matching should be based on graduate and managers preferences for each other with higher weighting put on the graduates preference.

You could also consider previous rotations, skills or any other attributes you think might be useful if you have time.

We have provided dummy data designed to help you test various edge cases.

You could also create a user interface to make the program more useable and to display interesting analytics.

Ask questions throughout the hackathon if you want more information!

## Assessment:

You will be judged by a panel with a variety of backgrounds.

You will do a 2 minute live demo showcasing your program and your code followed by questions from the judge&#39;s panel.

## Prerequisites:

We would recommend you setup a git repository for your team to collaborate easily together.

Feel free to use any technology stack you want. We would recommend either Java/Python. You could create a GUI using web based frameworks or Java/Python libraries if you have time.

## Rules:

There are no rules, just be nice
